Tableau Practice

## Step 1: Data Selection
Go to the Citi Bike Data source provided in the instructions.
Download 1-3 zip files of Citi Bike Trip History Logs. Ensure that the files you choose have the same columns and are preferably from within the past year.
- Downloaded the City Bike Trip History Log files for January 2023 - June 2023:
    - JC-202301-citibike-tripdata.csv
    - JC-202302-citibike-tripdata.csv
    - JC-202303-citibike-tripdata.csv
    - JC-202304-citibike-tripdata.csv
    - JC-202305-citibike-tripdata.csv
    - JC-202306-citibike-tripdata.csv

## Step 2: Data Preparation
Extract the downloaded zip files and combine them into a single dataset in a format that Tableau can handle (CSV, Excel, etc.).
Clean the data to ensure consistency and accuracy. Pay attention to any changes in data formats over time.
- Extracted the zip files in previous step
    - Used `app.ipynb` script to merge the six distinct .csv data files into one `combined_citibike_data.csv` data file

## Step 3: Connect Tableau to Data
Open Tableau and create a new workbook.
Connect Tableau to your prepared dataset.
- `Connected`

## Step 4: Data Analysis and Visualization
Start analyzing the data and create visualizations to answer the questions and discover the two unexpected phenomena.
For each question, design 2-5 visualizations (4-10 total). Use different chart types and visualization techniques to present the data effectively.
Use calculated fields as needed to calculate percentages, average trip duration, distance, etc.
Use Tableau's mapping capabilities to create the requested static or dynamic maps with zip code data overlaid.
- The Questions:
    - How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
    - By what percentage has total ridership grown?
    - How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
    - What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
    - What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
    - Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?
    - Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?
    - Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?
    - Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?
    - How does the average trip duration change by the type of user? (This may be under "User Type" or "member_casual" depending on the period the data is from).
    - What is the average distance in miles for a bike trip?
    - Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
    - How variable is the utilization by bike ID?
    - `Create my own question!`

## Step 5: Dashboard Creation
Create individual dashboards for each phenomenon you discovered, organizing related visualizations together.
Ensure that your visualizations are visually appealing, colorful, and easy to understand for non-technical audiences.
Add insightful and concise analysis in each dashboard explaining the phenomena you discovered and the trends observed.
- 

## Step 6: Tableau Story
Create a Tableau Story to bring together all the dashboards, visualizations, and maps.
Arrange the dashboards in a logical flow to tell a compelling data-driven narrative.
Ensure that your Tableau Story is professional and engaging, keeping in mind your audience, which includes city officials and public administrators.
- 

## Step 7: Final Review
Review your Tableau workbook, dashboards, and Tableau Story to ensure everything is accurate, visually appealing, and well-organized.
Proofread your analysis and descriptions for clarity and correctness.
- 
## Step 8: Save and Share
Save your Tableau workbook to Tableau Public.
Get the URL of your Tableau Public workbook and submit it along with any additional files used in your analysis.
- 

## Step 9: Considerations
Throughout the process, keep in mind the needs of your audience, the city officials, and their requirements for easy-to-understand, actionable insights.
- 

## Pay attention to design elements such as color schemes, fonts, and visual storytelling to match the Citi Bike program's visual style.
Utilize Tableau's features to manipulate data, add calculated fields, and create insightful visualizations.
- 

## Step 10: Present with Confidence
Present your Tableau Story with confidence, showcasing your analytical skills and abilities to analyze and visualize complex data.
